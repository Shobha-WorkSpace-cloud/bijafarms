# Backend Separation Complete

The backend has been successfully separated into its own project. Here's how to run the application:

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Both Frontend and Backend Together

```bash
npm run dev:fullstack
```

### Option 2: Run Separately

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
npm install  # (if not already done)
npm run dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure Changes

- **Frontend**: Runs on `http://localhost:8080`
- **Backend**: Runs on `http://localhost:3001`
- **API Endpoints**: `http://localhost:3001/api/`

## What Changed

1. **New `backend/` directory** with separate Node.js/Express project
2. **Frontend now calls `http://localhost:3001/api/`** instead of integrated `/api/`
3. **Main project** is now frontend-only
4. **Shared types** are copied to backend for now (alternative: npm workspace)

## Development Workflow

1. Start both frontend and backend servers
2. Frontend automatically proxies API calls to `localhost:3001`
3. Both support hot reload independently
4. Backend data is stored in `backend/src/data/` JSON files

## Backend Features

- All existing API endpoints preserved
- CORS configured for frontend origin
- Environment variables for configuration
- Separate build and deployment process

## Frontend Changes

- API configuration updated to point to localhost:3001
- Removed Express server integration
- Simplified build process

## Next Steps

Consider using:

- **Database**: Replace JSON files with PostgreSQL/MongoDB
- **npm workspaces**: Share types between frontend/backend
- **Docker**: Containerize both services
- **Deployment**: Separate deployments for frontend and backend services
